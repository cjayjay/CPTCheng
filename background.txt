In many decision problems the primary beneficiaries of the outcomes induced by the decisions taken are humans.
Examples range from public 
to private sector policy making (e.g., policies on education, health, transportation, ergonomics, job satisfaction, etc.).

Traditionally: Expected utility theory (EUT) is used.
Here, we consider cumulative prospect theory (CPT), which is a special case 
of  Generalized Utility Theories.
Why? 
1) Strictly generalizes EUT.
2) Better predictor of human choices (preferences) when humans are subjected to choose between alternatives with uncertain outcomes.
(CPT outperforms expected utility theory if the gambles involve small probabilities and/or large payoffs.)

Debate whether such generalized utility theories should be used in a prescriptive role,
  or whether they should be relegated to a descriptive role (to explain observed preferences of human decision makers)
  we do not see much problem with this, as generalized utility theory (and in particular, cumulative prospect theory)
  strictly generalizes expected utility theories.

" Thaler and Sunstein’s book Nudge,21 which advocates leveraging behavioral insights to design policies that promote desired behaviors while preserving freedom of choice. A number of edited volumes of behavioral policy insights from leading scholars have followed.22–25"

"A behavioral perspective on incentives also recognizes that the impact of monetary payments and fines depends on how people subjectively interpret those interventions. For instance, a field experiment in a group of Israeli day care facilities found that introducing a small financial penalty for picking up children late actually increased the frequency of late pickups, presumably because many parents interpreted the fine as a price that they would gladly pay.36 Thus, payments and fines may not be sufficient to induce desired behavior without careful consideration of how they are labeled, described, and interpreted.""

 [..] sceptics in the policy community are surprisingly prevalent. In 2012, I surveyed how our public-service personnel use evidence in making policy4. Several ministries stated that their job was to design policy that met the minister's requirements, not to advise on policy options on the basis of available evidence. Studies in Canada and Australia9 found similar results.
 
 
Social policy has not historically benefited from the kind of investment in public research capabilities that areas such as conservation and primary production have had over the years. Indeed, the infrastructure and capabilities for policy-relevant science advice is quite established in these areas. The same cannot be said for the social sciences. It is perhaps for this reason that incorporation of robust social science research into policy making remains a challenge (and one that is not unique to New Zealand).

How Can Policy Theory Have an Impact on Policy Making?

Policy making: Not top-down, but interactive.
 ideals from past: comprehensive rationality, policy cycle
 comprehensive rationality: elected policymakers translate their values into policy in a  straightforward  manner. They  have  a  clear,  coherent  and  rank-ordered  set  of  policy  preferences  which organisations carry out in a ‘logical, reasoned and neutral way’.
 There are  clear - cut  and  ordered  stages  to  the  process  (aims  are  identified,  the  means  to  achieve  those aims  are  produced  and  one  is  selected)  and  analysis  of  the  policymaking  context  is  comprehensive.

The policy cycles approach is, to some extent, an offshoot of that idea.  The suggestion  is  that stages  can  be  used  to organise  policymaking
; policymakers  should  divide the  process  into  a  series  of  stages  to  ensure  policy  success:  identify  policymaker  aims, identify  policies  to  achieve  those  aims,  select  a  policy  measure,  ensure  that  the  selection  is legitimised  by  the  population  or  its  legislature,  identify  the  necessary  resources,  implement and then evaluate the policy.

"naive approach to policy analysis".
.. comprehensive rationality and stage-based decision-making are ideals to aspire to..
 Comprehensive  rationality  is  used  to  explain  why policymaking  cannot  be  comprehensively  rational,  while  the  cycles  approach  is now  often identified  to  show  us  why  it  is  difficult  or  impossible  to  separate  policymaking  into  stages.

 Defining Human-Centered System Issues for Verifying and Validating Air Traffic Control Systems.

 questions arise concerning what aspects of  the human-system component must be addressed to verify system safety and efficiency.  Such questions are not trivial.  They strike at the heart of  the  "omnipresent criterion problem" (Christensen, 1958), that is, the difficulty of defining criterion measures for verifying and validating complex systems.
 The central argument is that before criteria and measures can be specified, human-
 centered issues associated with ATC technology upgrades must be carefully determined.
 An approach is discussed for disclosing such issues drawing on  techniques and
 philosophies from traditional human factors engineering, cognitive systems engineering,
 and ethnography.

 Traveler Behavior and Values Research for Human-Centered Transportation Systems
 A1C04: Committee on Traveler Behavior and Values
 ``Understanding human behavior and human values was recognized many years ago as a key
 ingredient in the planning of communities. 
 In-depth understanding of human nature is
 essential to the planning, design, and operational analysis of transportation systems.
 However, quantitative tools to understand human behavior and values have only partially
 been
 developed in the past few decades. In this area, basic and applied research has been
 very active, and it is only lately that we realize the benefits in practical applications.
 Incorporation of research findings into decision making for public policy has been slow, but
 it is accelerating, mainly because of recent environmental and transportation legislation and
 associated research investments in most of the industrialized world. A similar but much
 faster trend is observed in private enterprise, where market forces are imposing efficiency
 and customer service that requires understanding of human nature. These trends are
 expected to continue with increasing urgency for better decision-support tools designed
 around human needs and wants. In parallel, new scientific fields of research will continue to
 develop and strengthen, providing the milestones and support needed to understand,
 describe, and predict human behavior. 
 The need for better tools provides strong support and
 motivation for the ideas and activities of the Committee on Traveler Behavior and Values.

 The committee promotes research and disseminates research results on traveler values,
 attitudes, and behavior. “Traveler values and attitudes” refers to motivational, cognitive,
 situational, and 
 dispositive factors determining human behavior. “Traveler behavior” refers
 primarily to the modeling and analysis of travel demand on the basis of theories and
 analytical methods from a variety of scientific fields. 
 They include, but are not limited to, the
 use of time and its allocation to travel and activities, the use of time in a variety of time
 contexts and stages in the life of people, and the organization and use of space at any level
 of social organization, such as the individual, the household, the community, and other
 formal or informal groups. Behavioral issues are also considered in the movement of goods
 to the extent necessary. The committee is North America’s major forum for the
 development, promotion, and testing of experimental or emerging interdisciplinary methods.''

 The White House is encouraging the use of behavioral science techniques, and in September issued an executive order intended to incorporate how people make decisions into policies and programs.
 
 -----------
 

Decision making in business, economics, and social sciences is omnipresent yet at the same time it becomes highly difficult to comprehend and model human mental processes. In general, in spite of their diversity the decision problems exhibit a number of highly visible features:
• the objective of the decision problem is ambiguous;
• the problem structure describing the relationship among sub-problems might be
loosely specified;
• preference relations are not explicitly stated;
• knowledge of the organizational environments is uncertain;
• available information is often imprecise, uncertain or there might be an acute
lack of information; and
• one-time decision models are needed when dealing with unrepeated problems
with partially available information.
The classical decision theories, such as the expected utility (EU) theory of von Neumann and Morgenstern, and the subjective expected utility (SEU) theory of Savage cannot fully address the complexity of the problems and still a number of open critical questions remain that need to be thoroughly addressed.
This edited volume aims to offer effective methods to deal with different types of uncertainty inherently existing in decision problems and deliver comprehensive decision frameworks to handle different decision scenarios under various facets of uncertainty. The objective is to bring forward diverse decision-making models, which help use effectively the explicit and tacit knowledge and intuition, model perceptions and preferences in a more human-oriented style, and form decisions which become more in rapport with a human line of thinking.


In decision theory, lack of knowledge is divided into the two major categories ‘risk’ and ‘uncertainty’ [31], p.20 Chap.7 where “risk” refers to situations where the decision-maker can assign mathematical probabilities to the randomness which he is faced with, where and “uncertainty” refers to situations when this randomness “cannot” be expressed in terms of specific mathematical probabilities.

Human-centric reinforcement learning

Christopher P. Nemeth: Human Factors Methods for Design Making Systems Human-Centered.
``I will confess up front that I have a bias: people matter. This bears mention here, because a number of current popular trends lead away from, rather than toward, the better use of technology to serve human needs and wants: technophilia, pseudoscience, revenge effects and perception management.''
``Human Factors Methods for Design provides selected information on human traits that have particular import for research and development and provides methods for research and development work. ‘Methods’ are a powerful means to collect, use and evaluate information. They can be used in a wide variety of applications.
In this text, ‘product’ refers to the result of a development effort: artifacts (such as a tool or machine), services and systems. These products do not exist in a vacuum. They typically exist within a real world environment that includes humans and other products. For that reason, the meaning of the word ‘product’ in this book includes artifacts, software, services and systems.
This book provides a way to design products that extend, amplify and enhance human capabilities. Use it to define and solve problems, to develop new solutions and to evaluate their effectiveness.''

``Why ‘human factors’?
Life is not easy.'' ``Products are developed and exist to serve human needs.''
``But how do we know what people need? ''
``Every day, people around the world who are at work and play enjoy the use of products, buildings and services. Much of the human experience each day relies on items that were made to extend human abilities and to overcome human limits. The sum of all the products, services, environments and systems that humans have produced comprises the operational environment (OE). ''
``Humans are in and of their systems; they are not apart from them. (Julie Christensen)''


``The natural sciences are concerned with how things are. Design, on the other hand, is concerned with how things ought to be, with devising artifacts to attain goals.
(Herbert Simon)''

``Human factors and ergonomics''
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_factors_and_ergonomics
``Human factors and ergonomics (HF&E), also known as comfort design, functional design, and systems,[1] is the practice of designing products, systems, or processes to take proper account of the interaction between them and the people who use them.''


"human-centric" to refer to groups or processes that aim for deep participation ("deep democracy") with a fundamental goal of meeting multiple human needs (not only financial gain).  Human-centric decision-making values and explicitly deals with diverse needs and opinions more than traditional "voting."

Goal: Improve human condition

=======

Decision problems where the main beneficiaries, or subjects of decisions are humans abound.
Examples include making policies on education, health, transportation, ergonomics, job satisfaction, etc.,
covering the whole spectrum of policy making, from the public to the private sector.
As humans are the main beneficiaries, it is natural to start by modeling human preferences so that
a formal analysis of the decision problem can identify the best course of actions, or policies.


Traditionally: Expected utility theory (EUT) is used.
Here, we consider cumulative prospect theory (CPT), which is a special case 
of  Generalized Utility Theories.
Why? 
1) Strictly generalizes EUT.
2) Better predictor of human choices (preferences) when humans are subjected to choose between alternatives with uncertain outcomes.
(CPT outperforms expected utility theory if the gambles involve small probabilities and/or large payoffs.)

Debate whether such generalized utility theories should be used in a prescriptive role,
  or whether they should be relegated to a descriptive role (to explain observed preferences of human decision makers)
  we do not see much problem with this, as generalized utility theory (and in particular, cumulative prospect theory)
  strictly generalizes expected utility theories.

%Risk-sensitive reinforcement learning (RL) has received a lot of attention recently (cf. \cite{borkar2010learning,borkar2010risk,tamar2012policy,Prashanth13AC}). Previous works consider either an exponential utility formulation (cf. \cite{borkar2010learning}) that implicitly controls the variance or a constrained formulation with explicit constraints on the variance of the cost-to-go (cf. \cite{tamar2012policy,Prashanth13AC}). Another constraint alternative is to bound a coherent risk measure such as Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR), while minimizing the usual cost objective (cf. \cite{borkar2010risk,prashanth2014policy}).  

In this paper we consider human-based decision and more specifically reinforcement learning (RL) problems
